# Crops
- Add a crop manager
- Implement tick system
- Each crop has an unique base64 id
- The crop manager renders the crops
- Each crop has a simple "state" variable from 1-10 depending on the crop type
- Every tick (1 minute) the crops may or may not grow depending on some factors

# Selling and buying crops
### Ideas
- Simple keyboard controlled shop for seeds
