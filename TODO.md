# Picker
- Add option to select between different tools (hoe, shovel, sickle,seeds)
- Have a icon in the bottom right corner showing what tool you have selected
- When selecting a seed type a window pops up with the different seed types and how many you have of each

# Crops
- Add a crop manager
- Implement tick system
- Each crop has an unique base64 id
- The crop manager renders the crops
- Each crop has a simple "state" variable from 1-10 depending on the crop type
- Every tick (1 minute) the crops may or may not grow depending on some factors

# Selling and buying crops
### Ideas
- Simple keyboard controlled shop for seeds

# Bugs
- Wierd error with the collumns
