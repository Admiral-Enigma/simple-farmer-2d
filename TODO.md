# Picker
- Add option to select between different tools (hoe, shovel, sickle,seeds) - Done

- When selecting a seed type a window pops up with the different seed types and how many you have of each

# Crops
- Add a crop manager - Done
- Implement tick system - Done
- The crop manager renders the crops - Done
- Add a "Seed bank"
- Each crop has a simple "state" variable from 1-10 depending on the crop growth

- Simple keyboard controlled shop for seeds
